# Perfect Numbers

## perfect_numbers.py
Finds perfect numbers up to 1000 (or less).

I wrote this code before I found a mathematical formula to compute perfect numbers, so it is comparatively long and inefficient.

## upgrade.py
Now this code is written using that mentioned mathematical formula (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number), so it is much more efficient and concise.

## Code
There is some explanation of the code inside the files.
